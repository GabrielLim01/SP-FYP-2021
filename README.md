# Creation of branches

## Naming syntaxes **FOLLOW PLEASE**

###### newFeature/FeatureName

###### FIXME/IssueName

**DO NOT CREATE BRANCHES AFTER YOUR NAME BECAUSE IT MAKES NO SENSE**

**DO NOT DO MULTIPLE TASKS IN ONE BRANCH, BREAK IT DOWN TO PER FEATURE**

# RULES

- If you are unsure of what you are commiting, pushing please **ASK** before doing so.
- **DO NOT** leave your code uncommited over the night even if incompleted. Just continue the next day.
- THIS IS NOT A PLAYGROUND REPO SO **DO NOT** push anything funny.

## CHEERS! ALL THE BEST FOR FYP

Basic Git commands:

- Git push
- Git pull
- Git checkout -b <branchName>
- Git status
- Git stash
- Git pop

**Merging of branches will only be done by Gabriel. He is the main IC for this.**
